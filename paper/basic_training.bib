  abstract = {Growing computing capacity and algorithmic advances have facilitated the study of increasingly large biomolecular systems at longer timescales. However, with these larger, more complex systems come questions about the quality of sampling and statistical convergence. What size systems can be sampled fully? If a system is not fully sampled, can certain ``fast variables'' be considered well-converged? How can one determine the statistical significance of observed results? The present review describes statistical tools and the underlying physical ideas necessary to address these questions. Basic definitions and ready-to-use analyses are provided, along with explicit recommendations. Such statistical analyses are of paramount importance in establishing the reliability of simulation data in any given study.},

  abstract = {Despite more than three decades of effort with molecular dynamics simulations, long-timescale (ms and beyond) biologically relevant phenomena remain out of reach in most systems of interest. This is largely because important transitions, such as conformational changes and (un)binding events, tend to be rare for conventional simulations ($<$10$\mu$s). That is, conventional simulations will predominantly dwell in metastable states instead of making large transitions in complex biomolecular energy landscapes. In contrast, path sampling approaches focus computing effort specifically on transitions of interest. Such approaches have been in use for nearly 20 years in biomolecular systems and enabled the generation of pathways and calculation of rate constants for ms processes, including large protein conformational changes, protein folding, and protein (un)binding.},

WE software can be used to control any dynamics engine, such as standard molecular dynamics and cell-modeling packages.

We furthermore discuss the challenges that need to be overcome in the next phase of WE methodological development.
